# Restaurant Page

## Description
The goal was to create a simple restaurant SPA using javascript to generate html with webpack to help bundle all project files. This project was done as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) learning path.

**Live demo is accessible [here](https://durajrafal.github.io/RestaurantPage/).**

## My improvements
* Instead of using javascript I decided to use typescript.
* Menu items are imported from csv file.
